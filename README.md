## About Me
My name is Kaylyn, a 23-year-old graduate born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa.

I graduated from university with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics in June 2020. Being the lifelong learner that I am, I also challenged myself to complete an immersive Data Science Bootcamp in December 2019 and have since graduated with an overall grade of 97%.

I pride myself on my quick thinking, my incredible work ethic and integrity, the passion that I pour into everything that I do, and the fact that there are very few things that *don't* interest me. I am both proud of and grateful for the fact that my studies were entirely funded by me through hard work, determination and perseverance (and unbelievable multi-tasking skills too). I did this by waitressing, teaching English and au pairing whilst studying full-time.

When I am not putting my skills to good use or doing a new and exciting online course, you'll find me reading an interesting book, gardening, looking through a telescope, behind the wheel on an adventure, or figuring out how to use my skills and unique personality for the betterment of the environment and the advancement of humankind.
